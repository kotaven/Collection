In Java, a collection is an object that represents a group of elements. The Java Collections Framework provides a set of classes and interfaces to handle and organize collections of objects. Collections can be used to store, retrieve, manipulate, and process data efficiently.
The key interfaces in the Java Collections Framework include:
Collection: The root interface for all collection types. It represents a group of objects known as elements. It defines the basic methods that all collections will have, such as add, remove, and size.
List: An ordered collection that allows duplicate elements. Lists can be accessed by index, and they maintain the order of elements as they are inserted.
Set: An unordered collection that does not allow duplicate elements. Sets are useful when you want to ensure that each element in the collection is unique.
Map: A collection that stores key-value pairs, where each key is associated with exactly one value. Maps are useful for building associations between objects.
Queue: A collection designed for holding elements prior to processing. Queues typically follow the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) order.
